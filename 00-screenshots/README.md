This folder contains screenshots of linux suitable for ads.

Screenshots should be minimalistic with just a few elements. The screenshot should convey simplicity, elegance, a sense of luxury and beauty.

Things to avoid:
- landscape backgrounds: they distract from the desktop
- desktops with many widgets: we want simplicity
- too many open windows: focus on a pleasant relaxing environment, not work

Use:
- abstract backgrounds
- empty desktops: they leave space for text 

For the first batch we've opted for GNOME on Debian.
