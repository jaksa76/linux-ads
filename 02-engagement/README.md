In the second phase we want to create Engagement.

Here the viewer should learn that this is Linux.

The CTA should link to further information about Linux. We should convince that that it is **better**. Not cheaper, not more ethical, but better.

We can start talking about some advantages:
- it is secure
- no spyware
- no controlling corporations
- simple and easy to use
- tousands of apps
- makes your computer fast

We should still avoid being too technical. Our target are occasional PC users, not tech entusiasts.

Avoid mentioning at this stage
- open source
- Linux being free

Ad copy examples:
- Your computer, without hidden watchers.
- Fast again — with Linux.
- Thousands of apps, one simple system.
- Security built in, not added later.
- Linux: simple, stable, reliable.
- Linux makes everyday tasks easier.
- Built to be helpful, not pushy.
- Your computer, on your terms.
- Privacy that just works
- Built for people, not advertisers
- No corporations in the background
