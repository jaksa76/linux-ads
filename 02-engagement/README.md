In the second phase we want to create Engagement.

Here the viewer should learn that this is Linux.

The CTA should link to further information about Linux. We should convince that that it is **better**. Not cheaper, not more ethical, but better.

We can start talking about some advantages:
- it is secure
- no spyware
- no controlling corporations
- simple and easy to use
- tousands of apps
- makes your computer fast

We should still avoid being too technical. Our target are occasional PC users, not tech entusiasts.

Avoid mentioning at this stage
- open source
- Linux being free
