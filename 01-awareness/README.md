This folder contains images suitable for the first phase of marketing.

In the first phase of marketing we want to create awareness and interest. The viewer should ask themselves "What is this?".

The ads should set the tone of presenting something luxurous, desireable, exclusive. It should almost look like an ad for a perfume or jewlery. 

At this point we don't mention that Linux is free, fast, light on resources, open source or anything technical.

**We don't even need to say it is Linux.** We just want to show them beautiful desktops.

Possible ad copy:
- Designed to feel right
- Where simplicity lives
- Elegance, without effort
- A better desktop experience
- Space to think
- Nothing in the way

We want to use recognizable elements.
